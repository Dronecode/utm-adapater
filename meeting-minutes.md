Hey folks, welcome to the workgroupâ€™s first meeting; we are kicking off with an overview of the project and a goal alignment meeting.

Goal Discussion: The team agrees the main goal for the project is to build an open-source configurable adapter for QGC that can submit telemetry to participating UTM providers:

1. The scope of the adapter is the four U-Space mandatory services: Net-RID, Strategic De-confliction / Flight Authorization, Traffic Information and Geozones
2. The optional service of Conformance monitoring is also included in scope.
3. Integration of weather service is a strech goal, the standard for weather has been released, need to review it after the initial work is complete.
4. We discussed changes to the QGCS User interface and how the work will be handled
5. Changes to Mavlink / Mavlink protocol is outside of scope of the project at this moment. 

Next Steps: We are putting together data requirements for the interfaces and discussing before the meeting. The data will be distributed before the meeting starts.
