# QGCS UTM Adapter Project
## Goal
The goal of this work is to develop a UTM focused working group within Dronecode membership and build an open / configurable adapter for QGCS to enable it to submit telemetry to a UTM system. The adapter would be configurable so that the operator can specify what UTM system it wants to send data to. The UTM system in turn must implement those APIs to inject data from QGCS. 
## Scope

Figure: Image depicting the scope of ASTM Network RID standard, the part in Red: the way operators submit data to the UTM system is not standardized and we hope to build an API specification and a configurable implementation for that. 

## Deliverables

1. OpenAPI document specifying the adapter + relevant documentation of configuring adapter 
2. API to be implemented at the UTM Service Provider side
3. Implement Adapter + configuration file in QGCS that enables submission of data 
4. Integration of this adapter in QGCS builds + test
5. 
## Timeline
- Start date: 31 May 2023 -  30 November 2023 (6 months)
- Evaluation phase: December + January 2023 / re-work
